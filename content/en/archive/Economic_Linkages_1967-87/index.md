excerpt2: "In this article Strange sets Miller's work into the context of the analysis of international relations. Her central argument is two-fold - firstly, changes in the international political economy can only by understood through an analysis of structural power. And again she explicitly recognises the Marxist approach as both powerful and incomplete. She then stresses the continuing if changing role of the state, and state based authority. She suggests that this accounts for the continuing appeal of Realism. Having discussed a number of changes in international relations, she attributes to her former colleague (Miller was at Chatham House at the same time she was) a perspective consistent with her own."

Strange, Susan. "Economic Linkages 1967-87." In *The West and the Third World: Essays in Honour of J.D.B Miller*, edited by Robert O'Neill, John Vincent, 224-241. Basingstoke: Macmillan Academic and Professional, 1990.

In this article Strange sets Miller's work into the context of the analysis of international relations. Her central argument is two-fold - firstly, changes in the international political economy can only by understood through an analysis of structural power. And again she explicitly recognises the Marxist approach as both powerful and incomplete. She then stresses the continuing if changing role of the state, and state based authority. She suggests that this accounts for the continuing appeal of Realism. Having discussed a number of changes in international relations, she attributes to her former colleague (Miller was at Chatham House at the same time she was) a perspective consistent with her own.
