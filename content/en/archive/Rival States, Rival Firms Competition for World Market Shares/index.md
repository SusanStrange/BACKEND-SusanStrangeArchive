title: "States and Markets"
description: "States and Markets"
excerpt: "A self-avowedly part international relations - part international business management work which in keeping with Strange’s views discusses the interdependence between politics and economics without fore-grounding one at the expense of the other. The book builds on Strange’s theory of power and links it through three national studies (Brazil, Malaysia, Kenya) to a consideration of the effect of structural change in the international political economy on the role of TNCs in international economic development. The authors suggest that diplomacy is now triangular; (traditional) state-state diplomacy has been joined by state-firm, and firm-firm diplomacy in the international political economy. In addition they note that the linking of TNCs with specific nations is increasingly difficult, not least due to the decreasing centrality of territorial considerations of power. The book concludes with policy advise for both states and multinationals and pointers for further research."

A self-avowedly part international relations - part international business management work which in keeping with Strange’s views discusses the interdependence between politics and economics without fore-grounding one at the expense of the other. The book builds on Strange’s theory of power and links it through three national studies (Brazil, Malaysia, Kenya) to a consideration of the effect of structural change in the international political economy on the role of TNCs in international economic development. The authors suggest that diplomacy is now triangular; (traditional) state-state diplomacy has been joined by state-firm, and firm-firm diplomacy in the international political economy. In addition they note that the linking of TNCs with specific nations is increasingly difficult, not least due to the decreasing centrality of territorial considerations of power.
