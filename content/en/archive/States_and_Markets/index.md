excerpt2: "Although subtitled 'An Introduction...' to IPE, this represents the only book length discussion of Strange's theory of the four dimensions of power in IPE. It is at once an introduction to the subject and a forceful agenda setting exercise for further research. As such, though often appearing on undergraduate course reading lists, this is Strange's defining book, one about which the rest of her work revolves. Strange discusses her ideas on theory building and methodology as well as the four structures of power in the international political economy: security, finance, production and knowledge. This discussion is mobilised around the balance of authority and markets and the questions of value preferences, and of course 'cui bono?' (who benefits?). She then applies this analysis to a number of 'secondary structures'. Those who dismiss this as 'merely an introductory text' have completely missed the point! Prologue reprinted in: Authority and Markets: Susan Strange’s Writings on International Political Economy, edited by Roger Tooze and Christopher May. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2002."

Strange, Susan. *States and Markets*. London: Pinter Publishers, 1988.

Although subtitled 'An Introduction...' to IPE, this represents the only book length discussion of Strange's theory of the four dimensions of power in IPE. It is at once an introduction to the subject and a forceful agenda setting exercise for further research. As such, though often appearing on undergraduate course reading lists, this is Strange's defining book, one about which the rest of her work revolves. Strange discusses her ideas on theory building and methodology as well as the four structures of power in the international political economy: security, finance, production and knowledge. This discussion is mobilised around the balance of authority and markets and the questions of value preferences, and of course 'cui bono?' (who benefits?). She then applies this analysis to a number of 'secondary structures'. Those who dismiss this as 'merely an introductory text' have completely missed the point!

Prologue reprinted in:** *Authority and Markets: Susan Strange’s Writings on International Political Economy*, edited by Roger Tooze and Christopher May. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2002.**

Keywords: Foundational Work; Political Economy; Structural Power, Power; Theory; Authority vs Markets
