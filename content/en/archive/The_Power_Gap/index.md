title: "Economic Policy Making and the European Union: The Power Gap: Member States and the World Economy"
excerpt: "Strange criticises arguments that suggest the European Union is a sui generis political institution. She criticises such claims, self avowedly, not from a lengthy engagement with European political analysis, but from a more global concern with political economy. She suggests that except for the Commission there is little to distinguish the EU from some other intergovernmental organisations. And given the Commission’s inability to move on anything but essentially trivial matters she remains sceptical of the entire European project, remaining as she contends merely a sophisticated free-trade area. The problem, however, is not a particularly European one; the decline of state power vis-a-vis the global economy has been evident for some time. Only by recognising the problems for sovereign political authorities in the global political economy and planning for new constitutional developments in Europe to address this problem can this ‘power gap’ be narrowed. Strange here implicitly draws on the elements of her work that have supported the ‘state-in-decline’ thesis even though at other times she seems less willing to accept the absolute decline of state power than such arguments suggest."

Book Chapter: Strange criticises arguments that suggest the European Union is a sui generis political institution. She criticises such claims, self avowedly, not from a lengthy engagement with European political analysis, but from a more global concern with political economy. She suggests that except for the Commission there is little to distinguish the EU from some other intergovernmental organisations. And given the Commission’s inability to move on anything but essentially trivial matters she remains sceptical of the entire European project, remaining as she contends merely a sophisticated free-trade area. The problem, however, is not a particularly European one; the decline of state power vis-a-vis the global economy has been evident for some time. Only by recognising the problems for sovereign political authorities in the global political economy and planning for new constitutional developments in Europe to address this problem can this ‘power gap’ be narrowed. Strange here implicitly draws on the elements of her work that have supported the ‘state-in-decline’ thesis even though at other times she seems less willing to accept the absolute decline of state power than such arguments suggest.
