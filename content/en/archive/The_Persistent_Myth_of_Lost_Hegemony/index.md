Strange, Susan, "The Persistent Myth of Lost Hegemony." *International Organisation* 41, no. 4 (1987): 551-574.

Strange's classic attack of the 'declinist school' in international relations. Once she has discussed the more 'sociological' reasons for American academics holding this view (of which the most powerful/cynical is that it is essentially a convenient denial of responsibility by Americans for their effect on the international system), Strange goes on to elaborate the four structures of power in IPE. This exposition closely parallels (though in a brief form) the arguments that appear in **States and Markets (1988)**. Strange again identifies the American domestic political process (and constitutional structure) as being the root of many of international problems. Strange suggests that the domestic and international cannot be separated analytically, and her structural analysis of power explains the effects of American domestic politics on the international political economy. An earlier version was given in a conference paper presented to the 30th Annual Conference of the Japan Association of International Relations in Tokyo, October 1986.
