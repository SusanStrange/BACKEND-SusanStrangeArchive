Strange, Susan. "An International Political Economy Perspective." In *Governments, Globalization, and International Business*, edited by John H. Dunning, 132-145. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997.

In this chapter Strange lays out her idea of what International Political Economy is, including a wide-ranging view of politics (not just the activities of politicians and governments) and a focus on structural power. This then leads her to discuss the problems that globalisation presents for governments, business and people. She concludes that these problems require a re-examination of authority and justice both by states and by international business and adopting an IPE perspective facilitates such analysis. By trying to make a bridge between business research and international relations Strange returns again to the theme of breaking down disciplinary boundaries, see for instance **'International Political Economy: Reuniting three fields of intellectual endeavour' (1989)**.

Keywords: Globalization; Political Economy; Theory
