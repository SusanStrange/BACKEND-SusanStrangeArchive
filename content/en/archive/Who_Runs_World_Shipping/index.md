Strange, Susan."Who Runs World Shipping?" International Affairs 52, no. 3 (1976): 346-367.

In the first article Strange sets out an outline method for sectoral analysis in the international economy. This is prefaced by a critical engagement with the Nye and Keohane ‘<b>transnational politics</b>’ approach. After stressing the inseparability of politics and economics, and the crucial authority/market trade-off, she suggests three analytical questions that must be asked in any sectoral analysis; questions about the loci and distribution of power over economic processes, the who, why, and how of economic intervention, and the question of the consequences, and benefits. Only by building up from systematic sectoral analyses can the asymmetrical bargaining processes, the impact of technology, the influence of markets and the politicisation of the international political economy be understood. She then offers in the second article one such sectoral analysis (of world shipping), which carries some material forward from '<b>International shipping and the developing countries</b>' (with Richard Holland, 1976).
