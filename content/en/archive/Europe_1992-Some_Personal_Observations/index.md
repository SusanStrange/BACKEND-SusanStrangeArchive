Strange, Susan. Johannesburg: South African Institute of International Affairs, 1990.

In this record of a personal address, Strange suggests the 1992 project served both the European collective interest (in the face of Asian and American competition) and the national interests of the major European states (France and Germany), though as notes Britain's position is less clear cut. Post 1992 Strange suggests the democratic deficit (in European institutions), finance (the European Central Bank, co-ordination of banking regulations and the single currency), defence (and public procurement), reciprocity in international trade, and R&D are areas which are likely to be the most important for governments to attend to. But she also notes that identifying the boundaries of Europe, social (welfare) policy, immigration and national restrictive practices are all problems which though currently marginal will be aggravated by 1992.
