In February 2020, just before the pandemic closed everything down, Nat Dyer and I were having lunch at the British Museum cafeteria in London. Dyer, a researcher and author, had met online and had bonded over our shared admiration of Susan Strange. Naturally, our conversation turned to Strange, as we marvelled over her life and accomplishments: a White House correspondent at 23 years of age, time with The Economist and The Observer, co-founder of the academic discipline of International Political Economy (despite not having a PhD!), her prescient assessments of instability in the global financial system (which she dupped “casino capitalism”) and perseverance of US power in the 1980s and 1990s, to say nothing of her personal life (six kids and a hands-on farmer) and straight-talking approach that gave everyone who met her a story to tell.

We must’ve gotten somewhat animated, because in the middle of our discussion, two older women who were sitting next to us caught our attention, and one said, “We didn’t mean to overhear you, but who is the woman that you’re talking about? She sounds fascinating.”

Obviously, we couldn’t have agreed more.

This Archive, launched in Susan Strange’s centennial year, is a product of that conversation three years ago. Like our two dining companions, we remain fascinated, not just by Strange the person, but by her ideas and theories, which remain as relevant, or more, in the 2020s as they were in the second half of the 20th. We have designed this site to serve as a clearinghouse for work by and drawing on Susan Strange, and as a focal point for current and future researchers who, like us, continue to find insights in and inspiration from Strange’s remarkable work.
