This page is where cards are built for each object in the archive.  Text like this and top-of-page content can be edited at content>en>archive>_index.html

New objects are added by creating a new folder in content>en>archive and adding in an index.html file based on the template (refer to existing pages for template)

The image displayed on each card is drawn from the assets>images folder and is designated in the "Image: []" parameter in the index.html file for that object

The bold text on each card is designated by the "exerpt: []" parameter in the index.html file for that object

The details at the bottom of the card are designated in the parameters of the index.html file as well.

The details at the bottom of the card are rendered by the partial element created by the file at node_modules>@hyas>doks>layouts>partials>main>blog-meta.html
