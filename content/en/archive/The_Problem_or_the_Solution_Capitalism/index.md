Strange, Susan. "The Problem or the Solution? Capitalism and the State System." In *Innovation and Transformation in International Studies*, edited by Stephen Gill, James H. Mittelman, 236-247. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997.

Again Strange criticises International Relations for not focusing on the systemic problems, not least of all environmental and financial issues which a concern for inter-state relations misses. Thus International Political Economy is open to approaches from political geography, historical sociology and elsewhere that have not been fixated on the relations between states as the key causal factor in the global system. Globalised production and finance are integrating most areas into a global system and it is the system not states which analysis should focus on in the future. 

Keywords: Global Governance; Globalization; Money and Finance; Production; International Relations; Global System
