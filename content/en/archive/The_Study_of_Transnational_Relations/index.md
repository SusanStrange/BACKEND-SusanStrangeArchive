Strange, Susan. "The Study of Transnational Relations." International Affairs 52, no. 3 (1976): 333-345.

Using the ‘<b>Dollar Crisis</b>’ as a way of examining the problems which beset academic approaches to international relations Strange suggests that: foreign policy analysis seems unable to recognise the centrality of economic problems for states; (Neo)functionalism is far too optimistic concerning the possibility of international integration; much ‘abstract theorising’, such as game theory, seems to have no connection with what is happening in the international system; and international economics has diverted attention away from international political problems. Strange forcefully argues that: political economy is crucial to understanding international relations; the US is dominant due to its financial power, not its military or economic might; internationalisation (or now ‘globalisation’) diminishes the prospective advantages of regional economic solutions; the ‘market’ must be understood as an actor! Bearing these ideas in mind she then examines the ‘<b>Dollar Crisis</b>’ concluding that international institutions were revealed as powerless when the US wished to follow a specific policy (revealing its power). Strange would continue to refine this position during the next two decades.
