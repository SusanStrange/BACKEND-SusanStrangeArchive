Halbert, Debora J. "The Curious Case of Monopoly Rights as Free Trade: The TPP and Intellectual Property and Why It Still Matters." *Journal of Information Policy* 7 (2017): 204-227.

Using the framework of a knowledge structure as conceptualized by Susan Strange, this article addresses the loss of flexibilities in international intellectual property (IP) regimes and the corresponding global criminalization of IP as serious topics of concern. The knowledge structure of IP frames a very specific type of global political economy. First, Strange's approach to international political economy as it relates to IP is developed. Second, a brief history of global IP as a trade-related issue is discussed, including the current status of the Transpacific Partnership. Finally, some future trends that may suggest global shifts in the knowledge structure worth watching are investigated.
