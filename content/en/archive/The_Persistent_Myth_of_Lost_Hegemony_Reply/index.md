Strange, Susan "The Persistent Myth of Lost Hegemony: Reply to Milner and Snyder ['Lost Hegemony?']." *International Organisation* 42, no. 4 (1988): 751-752.

In reference to **'The Persistent Myth of Lost Hegemony' (1987)** there was a brief methodological exchange in the pages of International Organisation which while essentially inconclusive, offered a brief clue to Strange's attitude to empirical evidence. Though she originally cited empirical data, in response to the criticism from Milner and Snyder that this evidence left her arguments unproved, Strange answered that the real evidence to prove her argument empirically would be too difficult to collect, though in theory it could be possible to compile. What seems clear from this exchange, is that Strange is not dealing with 'evidence' in its strict form and has a permissive view towards its acceptability.

Keywords: Hegemony; Structural Power, Power; Theory
