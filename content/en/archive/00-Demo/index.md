This is the text that fills the static page for this object.  

You can put anything you want here in plaintext.

If you want to add special elemets like links or images you can use either markdown code:

[This is a link](http://www.google.ca)

or HTML code

<a href="http://www.google.ca">This is also a link</a> 

Images can be done similarly using markdown:

![An image a Daniel Brett](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DanielBrett/Intro-To-Git-Hub-March-1/main/Daniel_Headshot_Library_Reduced.jpg)

Or HTML code:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DanielBrett/Intro-To-Git-Hub-March-1/main/Daniel_Headshot_Library_Reduced.jpg" alt="An image of Daniel Brett">
