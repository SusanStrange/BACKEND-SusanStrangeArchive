Strange, Susan. "Europe and the United States: The Transatlantic Aspects of Inflation," In <i>The Politics of Inflation: Acomparative Analysis</i>, edited by Richard Medley, 65-76. New York: Pergamon Press, 1982.

This short article discusses the international financial sector and the interaction between American monetary policy and European exchange rates, monetary policy and the then new European Monetary System. While containing little explication of structural power, being more of an historical overview, the article is of interest for Strange’s concluding discussion of the reasons for American domination of the international financial structure. From these empirical reasons, there is a hint of the structural analysis that was implicitly being developed, not least of all because much of the evidence she cites re-emerges in later works regarding American economic hegemony.

Keywords: Hegemony, Money and Finance, Structural Power, Power
