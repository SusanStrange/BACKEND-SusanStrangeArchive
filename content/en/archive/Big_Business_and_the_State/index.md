Strange, Susan. "Big Business and the State." *Millennium Journal of International Studies* 20, no. 2 (1991): 245-250.

Strange argues in this short piece that TNCs should be placed at the centre of IPE analysis along with the state and should not be left on the periphery. She also argues for an outside-in understanding of TNCs, putting them into the context in which they operate to understand them. This context is being transformed by changes in the production and financial structures, while she implicitly also argues for the centrality of changes in the 'knowledge' structure.

Keywords: Corporations; Knowledge; Structural Power, Power; Theory
