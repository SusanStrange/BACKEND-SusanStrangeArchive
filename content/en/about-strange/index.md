Susan Strange (1923-1998) was one of the most innovative and interesting thinkers about global politics and economics in the late twentieth-century. After studying economics at the LSE during World War II, she began her working life as a journalist in the US and UK, before going on to co-found a new academic field, International Political Economy (IPE), despite never having received a doctorate. Her writing in the 1970s, 80s, and 90s about systemic risks in financial markets, America's global influence and more was ahead of its time and engaged deeply with power and history. She also had a remarkable personal story, as the most prominent woman academic in her field and the mother of six children.
