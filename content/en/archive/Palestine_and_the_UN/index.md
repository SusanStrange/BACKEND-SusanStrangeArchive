Strange, Susan. "Palestine and the UN." In *Year Book of World Affairs 1949*, George W. Keeton, Georg Schwarzenberger, editors. 151-168. London: Stevens, 1949.

Strange comments on the UN deliberations concerning the future of Palestine and highlights the central factor that gave the Zionists an in-built advantage at the assembly. While the Arabs were negotiating in a state that was essentially antipathetic to their struggle, their opposite numbers were surrounded by sympathisers and supporters both within and outside the organisation. She also discusses some of the limitations and problems with such negotiations within the forum of the UN, and alludes to structural impediments to the 'fair' settlement of differences.

Keywords: International Institutions; International Relations; United Nations
