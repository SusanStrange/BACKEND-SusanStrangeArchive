Strange, Susan. "An Eclectic Approach." In *The New International Political Economy (International Political Economy Year Book No.6)*, edited by Craig N. Murphy , Roger Tooze, 33-49. Boulder: Lynne Rienner Publishers, 1991.

Strange reiterates the structural dimensions of power from **States and Markets (1988)** and then goes on to develop this further by adding three conditioning factors that influence the structural elements of power - these are states, markets and technology. Essentially the new element here is the dynamic of technology. Strange makes the contribution of the technological dynamic to the four structures more explicit in this article than previously. She then concludes by again stressing the need for interdisciplinary understanding of IPE and how this should influence the teaching of the subject.
